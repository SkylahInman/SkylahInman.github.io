		<h2 class= "cool"> Intro </h2>
		<p> I decided to make this website into a blog because my friend told me it would be funny. So, welcome to the Skylah Inman blog, where all choices are made based on how funny it will be. Always think, is option one funnier, or is option two? option one being, boring art portfolio, option two being, stupid blog about goofy stuff. Clearly, option two is funnier. </p>
		
	<h2 id="bordering"> Thoughts On Life At The Moment </h2>
		<p id="important2"> as my first blog to prepare the mind as to what is to be expected, I will give not so deep thoughts on life. Not all life, just mine. ANYWAY, life is so fun right now, its amazing how having friends can make everything so amazing. like imagine a group of people you can just do whatever with any they won't judge you for being a weirdo. its amazing. I love friends. Of course, life would still be great without friends, I love doing stupid stuff on my own, but its just so much better to have stupid people to do stupid stuff with, you know? There are struggles in life, of course there are, but nothing a muscle mommy, queen, brilliant, artist, athlete, super star, such as myself cant handle (I'm so scrawny it hurts, ignore that). ANYWAY ANYWAY, life is good right now. if this were a real blog, I would chnage this depending on my life thoughts throughout the weeks or days, or whatever, but this is fine for now :D </p>

<p>This picture was taken week two of college, I think..? Speaking of week two college... let's talk about week one. Recently, I started college, and week one of college was so awful. I had to wake up early for all these orientation activities that I was required to go to, and I had NO FRIENDS!!!!! but then, it was like a miracle. I first met Kate rock climbing, and then she was at the slip and slide event, and we both met an awesome group of girls, and they forced me and her to go swimming with them. It was the most random experiance of my life, but I am so glad about it. Okay, now we can get back to week two. Week two rolls around, and we all turn into this massive group of friends! Then, in the middle of the night, Rina (the one in the picture) is like, "lets go do a photoshoot RIGHT NOW." it was the middle of the night, but who am I to argue? Remember, kids, the funniest option is always the best option. So, we took this beautiful nighttime photoshoot with Rina as our fabulous model. but things clearly weren't funny enough with all these <i>normal</i> pictures. So I went, "Lay on the stairs." She went to lay on them like a normal person, so I said, "no, lay across the top of all of them." And so she did. Truly the most beautiful picture of them all. I also drew it a few weeks later with my amazing 10/10 art skills. </p> 


<h3> Blog 2! 9/5/23 </h3>

<p>On a fine summer day, my friends and I decided to go swimming at the blue mesa reservoir. However, this fine day was not so fine. There was so much wind that it felt like it could blow you over, there was so much wind it created waves in the lake, there was so much wind that if someone went into the water, they would probably drown and die. you would be crazy to get in and go deep enough to actually start swimming.... right? WELL I'M CRAZY!!!! There was an island in the middle of the lake and new character Brian and I thought would be a great thing to swim to. And so, on our journey we went. We walked around the sand for like half a mile until we got to a point where we thought the current of the waves would be able to push us to the island. On our way, we found many treasures. but we had to start swimming eventually. we jumped into the lake, and the waves took us. I was sure I would drown about five times, but eventually, we made it!!! We named the island, Ooga Booga island. After exploring, a while, it was time to let the waves take us back to the mainland. a few of our treasures getting crushed later, Brian and I make it back.</p>

<p> Imagine being so bored that you decide to make a movie. Late night thoughts are really intrusive, and seem to have won against us. About a week ago, my friends and I decided to make this awful yet amazing movie. It started with Rina and I, (y’all met this character last blog) taking her long board to the very empty skate park. We were both horrible skateboarders, but that didn't stop up from speeding around and being silly. Eventually, we pulled our phones out and started recording goofy moments. But then, Rina, was like, "hey, wanna make a movie?" and I was like, "hell yeah I do." Lately, I have been obsessed with the Surfs up movie, so that is where my inspiration came from. The movie was in the back of my mind the whole time while improvising every line and scene. ANYWAY Rina and I were having a grand ol' time, when two more of our friends showed up. Brian, and new character Linds. They were so iconic in helping us film everything and even acting a few parts (a few as in... one. Rina and I acted in pretty much everything :,)). And so, this masterpiece was born. PLEASE WATCH ALL NINE MINUTES AND TWENTY FOUR SECONDS OF IT, IT IS SO GOOD!!!!

		<h3> Blog 4! 10/3/23</h3>
		<div class="flex-grid">
	<p> Every Tuesday night, Brian and I have to go to the NCAA required study hall. I'm not really sure why we have to go to it, but i guess it keeps us smart. anyway, earlier that day Brian was telling me about how he sat down on a couch and his airpods fell out of his pocket and the couch ate them. I told him that he should just go look in the couch, but he wanted to wait until no one was around to rip apart this poor couch. anyway, I think he may have looked there a few times without being able to find them. However, then a couple of hours later he comes to me and is like, 
	"My AirPods are in pinnacles." so someone took them, great!!! and then he was like, "After study hall want to go try and find them with me?" and I was like, "Of course, side character adventure part four." </p>
	<p> So on the adventure we went. with AirPods you can connect them to your phone and track them down, so with whatever app it was, we followed the map to the pods. we went through this dorm building floor to floor, holding the phone up in the air in hopes they would connect to them. finally, we get to the third floor. and in the middle of the hallway, they connect for a split second, Brian starts playing the noise and we listen into people's doors in hopes of hearing them, but then they disconnect. we think we have found the room they're in, but we are too afraid to knock. but then someone with this really cute dog starts going into the room across from the room we think they are in. We look to this girl with the dog and go, "Are the people that live in that room nice?" and she's like, "Yeah." so with the little courage we have, we knock on the door. they yell for us to come in but we yell back, "But we're strangers, and the door is locked!" so they come to open the door and we ask about the AirPods. they don't have them. </p>
	<p> I look to Brian and go, "What if they're right above us?" and we sprint up to the fourth floor. the AirPods then connect again and Brian starts playing the noise. we go door to door pressing our ears up against them to try and hear the airpods when finally, we hear the dingging. we go over to the door across the hall to make sure the noise isn't coming from there, and then head back to the room. we knock on the door once, and then we knock on it three more times really loudly, and we keep playing the noise over and over again until we head a door from the inside open. then we hear footsteps and another door open. then the sound of the AirPods getting closer.
